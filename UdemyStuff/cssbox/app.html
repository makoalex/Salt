      Jay would just repeat to me (if I asked), that I should make the expansion
      as good as it can be and then he'll deal with what cost or whatever that
      means. But I do nevertheless take into account the tokens/mats; they're an
      extra cost, and it's nice if the expansions are the same price. There's no
      special time I decide the size. I work on the set and gradually have more
      cards and more of an idea of what tokens/mats/landscapes/non-supply cards
      are in it. At some point I feel like, this wants to be this many cards.
      These days the size tends to be as large as it can be while including the
      other components.
